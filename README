Solunas Improved Solunas Hotel Booking Engine
This is a project from http://sourceforge.net/projects/solunas/ 
As a friend as me a question about the program,I find it a good e-commerce 

As you download from sourceforge.net you will meet many problems


First, You should modify database.yml (database name and mysql.sock location of your computer )
second, excute the query file solunas.sql (as some migration file lost from download )
last excute rake db:migrate
Then you can script/server to use it


Tips this is already two uses:
common user :  username==>demo  password: demo
Admin user  :  username==> admin password:admin
